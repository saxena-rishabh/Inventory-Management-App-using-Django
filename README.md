# Inventory Management App using Django

This is a inventory management app built using **Django having MySQL as a database.**    
It allows any user to **create, update and delete** inventory data for their store.
    
In this app I have **implemented both class based views and function based views** to implement the logic.    
    
This **app displays items in ascending order of exipery date of the item and also has logic to calculate number of days remaining in expiry** which is automatically calculated once any item is added. All items along with their days remaining in expiry can be viewed at the index page.     
**Any item which is going to expire in next 100 days will be shown in red color** helping owners to manage these items in time.
