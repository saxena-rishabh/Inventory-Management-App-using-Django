# Inventory Management App using Django

This is a inventory management app built using Django having MySQL as a database.
It allows any user to create, update and delete inventory data for their store.

In this app I have implemented both class based views and function based views to implement the logic.

This app displays items in ascending order of exipery date of the item and also has logic to calculate number of days remaining in expiry which is automatically calculated once any item is added. All items along with their days remaining in expiry can be viewed at the index page. 
Any item which is going to expire in next 100 days will be shown in red color helping owners to manage these items in time.

I have deployed this Inventory Management app on Amazon EC2.
